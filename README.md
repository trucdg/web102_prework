## Notes

Challenges: I was travelling during the past few weeks. Thus I didn't have a lot of time to make more customization to the page.
Another challenge was that I tried to come up with new ideas to alter the page but it only made the page look clustered and unappealing. Thus, I decided to kept it simple and neat.
